# calculator-source
This project is for hacking standard six function calculators for subtle programmability, ability to store variables and so forth.  This project is still in developing stage, and this is a temporary repository.
For now, some of this is irrelevant.
## How it Works
There are two versions of the code, one in java, and one in python, because the friend whom I wrote this with is more familiar working with java.  Choose whichever you wish.  At the time of writing this, the repository only contians the python source files.  There are two main files, calc_source, and calc_modules.  Calc_source contains the main operating file that runs the keypad, and main principles, and calc_modules contains the sub programs, such as quadratic formula, or whatever.  Calc_source calls modules from calc_modules, depending on which ones you include.  For example, you can write 100 modules, and choose to have 3 available.  You can also update which modules are stored on the calculator wirelessly
    
## How to Use
This is under development stage, but I will soon write a guide.  Clone this repository, and change calc_modules to include whatever programs *you* want.  In calc_source, include the programs you want to use at the time.  I am still improving modulation.
