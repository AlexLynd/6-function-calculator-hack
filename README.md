# calculator-source
This project is for hacking standard six function calculators for subtle programmability, ability to store variables and so forth.  This project is still in developing stage, and this is a temporary repository.
For now, some of this is irrelevant.
## How it Works
calc_source.py is the main source code, used for running other programs, like quadratic formula.
    
## How to Use
I use that as my own private repository with the programs for my calc, so clone it and add you own programs.
