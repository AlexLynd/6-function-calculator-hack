# CalcProbe
CalcProbe is a project that lets you hack standard 6 function calculators by exploiting input through the keypad matrix.  By placing a microcontroller inline with the PCB matrix of a calculator, we can intercept keystrokes, and spoof our own, to give real time output to the calculator LCD.  The possibilities are endless, and using the 20 buttons on a standard calculator, we can control a device like a Raspberry Pi Zero, to even connect to the internet.
## ChangeLog
* Startup script
* UART serial integration
* Code that actually works
* External SPI Micro-SD card interface for logs and stuff
* Battery management system with inductive charging (maybe)
## How it Works
it doesnt
